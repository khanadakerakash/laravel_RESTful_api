# `RESTful API` developemnt using  [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)

## Here, I have created a simple ecommerce demo application for `RESTful API` practice purpose<Enter>

**`Application Features`**
- APP_URL = [api_practice](http://api_practice.dev/)
- DB_DATABASE = api_practice
- Here, I created separate two controller class. One for web and another for API
- Here, I used `Traits` which is most interesting feature of php. And I have used it for producing exact JSON format output.
- I used [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop) addons of google chrome browser for checking API data.

- For chicking this `API` go to [api_test](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/323e9eb48ad3ff7771f0)
